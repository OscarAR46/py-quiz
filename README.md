# Python Quiz (WIP)

## System Summary
A quiz made by me in python
CURRENTLY BUILDING OUT AND SCAFFOLDING ONLY

## Current state
- system.py initial build out to assume base functionality before classes made and extended from this
- question class implemented and initial build out phase 1 complete on system.py with hardcoded questions, allows
multiple users and saves each users attempts, name etc
- user class finalised which stores user name, stores ALL quiz attempts, counts attempts, adds new attempts, calculates
best and worst performances (sep methods) and calculates a total avg of thier performances
